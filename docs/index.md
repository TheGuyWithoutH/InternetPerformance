# **Internet Performance**

## **What is Internet Performance Project?**
The project consist of a study of the performance of the Internet from the perspective of a user application. Twich API stream data are fetched and analyzed to determine the latency of a particular user, whose location is then determined using its twitter account. The data are anonymized and put in a database for further study.

Our goal is to make this data available to the public, so that the community can use it to study the performance of the Internet. There are two ways to interact with the dataset:
- a web interface to query the database and visualize the results
- a REST API to query the database and download the results
